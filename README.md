## My name is Dilan Gilluly, and this is my GitHub

Minted in the early 1990's, I slowly grew up into the era of the Internet. Currently I work as a Sr. Client Services Rep (Technology Services) for a SUNY institution. On top of buying music CD's and MP3's to add to my collection, I mountain bike, and also work on some personal projects I like to share, as hobbies.

## My work you might be interested in

- **Ticket Auction Manager 3**: Originally a Microsoft Access database, I eventually converted it to a MariaDB backend, then to entirely Python using FastAPI and TTKBootstrap libraries. And now it's using Sveltekit and Python (with FastAPI). Check it out either on its [Repo](https://www.github.com/dbob16/tam3) or [Releases](https://www.github.com/dbob16/tam3/releases).
