## My name is Dilan Gilluly, and this is my GitHub

Minted in the early 1990's, I slowly grew up into the era of the Internet. Currently I work as a Sr. Client Services Rep (Technology Services) for a SUNY institution. On top of buying music CD's and MP3's to add to my collection, I mountain bike, and also work on some personal projects I like to share, as hobbies.
