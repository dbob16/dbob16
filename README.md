## My name is Dilan Gilluly, and this is my GitHub

Minted in the early 1990's, I slowly grew up into the era of the Internet. Currently I work as a Sr. Client Services Rep (Technology Services) for a SUNY institution. On top of buying music CD's and MP3's to add to my collection, I mountain bike, and also work on some personal projects I like to share, as hobbies.

My main one is a Microsoft Access database which I originally made for the annual SPCA Serving Allegany County Theme Basket Auction. I'll share it on here once the current revision is done.

## Currently under construction

I'm in the process of reworking my GitHub profile and repos. Please stay patient while I get things back online and better than ever.
